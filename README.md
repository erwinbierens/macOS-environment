My personal stack of macOS configuration and tools

**IMPORTANT:** These are primarily meant for inspiration. I wouldn't just blindly use them. Please use them at your own risk!

## Tools 💻 
This is a collection of tools that i'm using on my macOS system. 

### Homebrew
Homebrew is package manager for macOS which makes installing lots of different software like Git, Ruby, and Node simpler. Homebrew lets you avoid possible security problems associated with using the sudo command to install software like Node.

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Commands to use: 

    brew update
    brew upgrade
    brew install <packagename>

Here you can find the full [man page](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage)

### Terminal
